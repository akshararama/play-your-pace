The following libraries necessary for this program are built into the python3 software
so make sure to import them at the top: 
tkinter, os, sys, wav and threading

The libraries you will need to download to use this software are openCV and pyaudio

the best way to install these libraries is using homebrew installer. 
you first must install homebrew
using the following code in terminal:
brew install portaudio
pip3 install pyaudio
you can find instructions on installing pyaudio here: https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/

the best way to install opencv is also through homebrew installer
using the command:
brew install opencv3

you must have all the files and the music files in one directory in order for this to work
you can replace music files with your own music but must make sure it is in WAV format 

(it is not common for files to be in .wav format, so specifically check this, they are typically in a lossier format such as MP3 etc)
